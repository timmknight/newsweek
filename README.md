This is a very rough project the first using bootstrap the goal here is just to get some knowledge of bootstrap and how it works not to create an excellent site therefore it is very rough but the focus is on the bootstrap girds and responsiveness, overall pretty pleased with how bootstrap worked and how quickly it allowed me to make a responsive layout, can see it being very useful for more projects in the future.
